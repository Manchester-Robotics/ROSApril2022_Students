# Mech-files for Traffic Lights
Read the PDF Files for assembly and cutting instructions
You will need to make to full assemblies (one for each traffic light) 
i.e., cut: 2 x MCR2_1008_11_Traffic_Light_Base_1 and 2 x MCR2_1008_11_Traffic_Light_Base_2
You will need some screws and standoffs (as described in MCR2_1008_11_Traffic_Light_Single_Assy)
